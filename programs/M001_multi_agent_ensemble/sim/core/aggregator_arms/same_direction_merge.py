"""Arm 3 of the Phi5 aggregator experiment -- same-direction merge.

When N >= 2 agents propose the SAME direction on the SAME symbol within
window W = 1 H4 bar (i.e. concurrent on the same tick close), merge into
a single AgentProposal with:

- SL = tightest (max stop for long, min stop for short)
- TP = median across proposal ladders' target prices
- Conviction = max across contributors (winner-takes-all)
- Source attribution = all contributing agent IDs journalled in rationale

This is DIFFERENT from the Phi2.5 `aggregator.aggregate` same-direction
rule (which SUMS conviction and picks winner's ladder). Arm 3 gives a
merged intent whose sizing is controlled by the max conviction, not the
sum -- prevents artificial size inflation from concurrent proposals.

Opposite-direction proposals are NOT touched by this arm (that's still
the aggregator's downstream opposing-highest-conviction rule).

Reference: `experiments/phi5_aggregator/PROTOCOL.md` §3.2 Arm 3.
