# Experiment registry

Master index of every hypothesis test in this repository. Numeric IDs
(`E001`, …) are collision-proof; legacy names (Test A, Test B) map to
`E006` / `E007` only.

**Discipline:** `PROTOCOL_DISCIPLINE.md` · **Data accounting:** `DATA_LEDGER.md`

| ID | Short name | Repo folder | Status | Pre-reg | Verdict (one line) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E001 | ICT concept ablation | [E001_concept_ablation](experiments/E001_concept_ablation/) | complete | executed-then-registered | Zone sole survivor; 6 concepts eliminated (BH-FDR grid) |
| E002 | Zone definitive grid | [E002_zone_definitive_grid](experiments/E002_zone_definitive_grid/) | complete | executed-then-registered | 13 BH-significant cells; candidate list only (in-sample) |
| E003 | Holdout IS/OOS | [E003_holdout_validation](experiments/E003_holdout_validation/) | complete | executed-then-registered | 1/8 IS-survivors validated OOS (H4/asia); selection-bias lesson |
| E004 | Walk-forward | [E004_walk_forward](experiments/E004_walk_forward/) | complete | executed-then-registered | H4/all 7/7 positive OOS windows; deployed cell chosen |
| E005 | Cross-pair + sealed | [E005_cross_pair_sealed](experiments/E005_cross_pair_sealed/) | complete | executed-then-registered | GBPUSD/USDCAD replicate; AUD/NZD excluded; 2026 sealed inconclusive |
| E006 | Price-action confluence (Test A) | [E006_test_a_price_action](experiments/E006_test_a_price_action/) | complete | yes (`2026-06-12`) | 5/284 alive hour-matched; gate-sized effects only |
| E007 | Impulse-origin bounce | [E007_impulse_origin_bounce](experiments/E007_impulse_origin_bounce/) | complete | yes (`b9715d9`) | 0/12 alive; bounce ≈ random hour-matched levels |

## Planned (not started)

| ID | Short name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| E008 | Technical indicators only | v2-PROTOCOL "Test B" family — EMA/RSI/MACD/etc.; own pre-registration |
| E009 | Cross-family confluence | v2-PROTOCOL "Test C"; A×B survivors; last |

## Pre-registered (Stage 0 ready to run)

| ID | Short name | Repo folder | Pre-reg | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E010 | Stage-2b equal_highs_pool | [E010_equal_highs_pool_stage2b](experiments/E010_equal_highs_pool_stage2b/) | yes (`fd8eb3d`, 2026-06-24) | H1 `equal_highs_pool` × 10 M15 setups; selection-term + displacement-null lift ≥ +0.10 ATR; BH-FDR α=0.05; Stage 1 EURUSD 2015–2021, Stage 2 EURUSD 2022–2024, Stage 3 GBPUSD 2015–2021 (cache-constrained), Stage 4 EURUSD H1+M15 2025–2026-06-09 (sealed, reserved). Runs parallel with M001; A6 Nagi confluence-only deployment-grade waits on E010 alive verdict. |

Register in this table **before** writing `experiments/E00X_*/PROTOCOL.md`.

## Agent-side vs lab-side

| E001–E005 | Ran in `multi-pair-trading-agent` (validation harness). Documented here retrospectively; code stays in agent. |
| E006–E007 | Ran in this repo (`finance-research-experiments`). Code and outputs live here. |

Production strategy locked in agent: **`zone_d1_against` / H4 / all** on
EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD. See E004 + E005 reports.

## How to add E011+

1. Copy `experiments/_TEMPLATE/` → `experiments/E011_your_hypothesis/`.
2. Add a row to the table above (`planned`).
3. Follow `PROTOCOL_DISCIPLINE.md` checklist.
4. Update `DATA_LEDGER.md` when Stage 1 starts.
